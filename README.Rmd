# spatsoc 

### [News](#news) | [Installation](#installation) | [Usage](#usage) | [Contributing](#contributing)

`spatsoc` is an R package for detecting spatial and temporal groups in GPS relocations. It can be used to convert GPS relocations to gambit-of-the-group format to build proximity-based social networks with grouping and edge-list generating functions. In addition, the `randomizations` function provides data-stream randomization methods suitable for GPS data and the `get_gbi` function generates group by individual matrices useful for building networks with `asnipe::get_network`. 

See below for [installation](#installation) and basic [usage](#usage). 

For more details, see the [blog post](https://ropensci.org/blog/2018/12/04/spatsoc/) and vignettes:

* [Introduction to spatsoc](https://docs.ropensci.org/spatsoc/articles/intro-spatsoc.html)
* [Frequently asked questions](https://docs.ropensci.org/spatsoc/articles/faq.html)
* [Using spatsoc in social network analysis](https://docs.ropensci.org/spatsoc/articles/using-in-sna.html)
* [Using edge list and dyad id functions](https://docs.ropensci.org/spatsoc/articles/using-edge-and-dyad.html)


## News
New edge-list generating functions added:

  * `edge_nn`
  * `edge_dist`
  
and dyad id function:

  * `dyad_id`
  
(feedback welcome as always!)

Both documented further in a new vignette: [Using edge list and dyad id functions](https://docs.ropensci.org/spatsoc/articles/using-edge-and-dyad.html).


Also, our article describing `spatsoc` was just published at Methods in Ecology and Evolution. [Link here](https://doi.org/10.1111/2041-210X.13215) and thanks to reviewers and editors at [rOpenSci](https://github.com/ropensci/software-review/issues/237) and at [MEE](https://besjournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/journal/2041210x).

## Installation
Install the latest version with `remotes`.  

```{r install}
remotes::install_github('ropensci/spatsoc')

# or CRAN
install.packages('spatsoc')
```

`spatsoc` depends on `rgeos` and requires [GEOS](https://trac.osgeo.org/geos/) installed on the system. 

* Debian/Ubuntu: `apt-get install libgeos-dev`
* Arch: `pacman -S geos`
* Fedora: `dnf install geos geos-devel`
* Mac: `brew install geos`
* Windows: see [here](https://trac.osgeo.org/osgeo4w/)


## Usage
### Load package, import data
`spatsoc` expects a `data.table` for all of its functions. If you have a `data.frame`, you can use `data.table::setDT()` to convert it by reference. If your data is a text file (e.g.: CSV), you can use `data.table::fread()` to import it as a `data.table`. 

```{r library}
library(spatsoc)
library(data.table)
DT <- fread(system.file("extdata", "DT.csv", package = "spatsoc"))
DT[, datetime := as.POSIXct(datetime, tz = 'UTC')]
```


### Temporal grouping
`group_times` groups rows temporally using a threshold defined in units of minutes (B), hours (C) or days (D).

### Spatial grouping 
`group_pts` groups points spatially using a distance matrix (B) and a spatial threshold defined by the user (50m in this case). Combined with `group_times`, the returned 'group' column represents spatiotemporal, point based groups (D).

`group_lines` groups sequences of points (forming a line) spatially by buffering each line (A) by the user defined spatial threshold. Combined with `group_times`, the returned 'group' column represents spatiotemporal, line overlap based groups (B).

`group_polys` groups home ranges by spatial and proportional overlap. Combined with `group_times`, the returned 'group' column represents spatiotemporal, polygon overlap based groups.

### Edge-list generating functions
`edge_dist` and `edge_nn` generate edge-lists. `edge_dist` measures the spatial distance between individuals (A) and returns all pairs within the user specified distance threshold (B). `edge_nn` measures the distance between individuals (C) and returns the nearest neighbour to each individual (D).

### Social network analysis functions
`randomizations` for data-stream randomization and `get_gbi` for generating group by individual matrices.
